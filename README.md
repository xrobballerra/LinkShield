## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do you store my account key?**  
A: No. Your key stays in your browser only — never leaves your device. Close the tab, and it’s gone.

**Q: Why does unrestrict require an extra step?**  
A: For security, direct browser access is blocked. LinkShield handles this privately — with zero data collection.

**Q: Is the “Download HTML” version safe?**  
A: Yes. It’s a single file you control — no installation, no background activity. You can inspect it anytime.

**Q: Will the free version always stay free?**  
A: Yes. Core features (1-link, UI, offline use) will always be free — no hidden paywalls.

**Q: Do I need a debrid subscription?**  
A: Yes — LinkShield works with your existing debrid service account (e.g., Real-Debrid). You provide your own API key.
